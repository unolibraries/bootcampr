# BootcampR: An R Workshop 

This repository contains the code for generating the [BootcampR workshop](https://jasonheppler.org/courses/bootcampr.2020/).

Various hugo and blogdown features borrowed more or less directly from [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com) and [Kieran Healy](http://kieranhealy.org).
